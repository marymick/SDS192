# Lec 4

## Announcements

* **Extra office hours today 3:30-5pm in McConnell 215**
* For those of you with interests in Biology: Reed College's Prof Derek Applewhite ["The Spatial and Temporal Regulation of Non-muscle Myosin II Contractility"](https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/1040272556991959041){target="_blank"} talk on Monday afternoon.
* Added note about when to do DataCamp courses to [syllabus](syllabus.html#evaluation-expectations): *You do not need to complete any DataCamp courses in preparation for future lectures; they will always be explicitly assigned*.
* Solutions to previous lecture's learning checks will be posted directly underneith question. Ex: Look at [LC2.1 Solutions](https://moderndive.netlify.com/2-getting-started.html#exploredataframes){target="_blank"} I just posted.

## Today's Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk

The Grammar of Graphics: the theoretical underpinnings of statistical graphics

### 2. In-class exercise 1: R code scratchpads

**Question**: Should I be copying/pasting/tweeking code directly in the console window?  
**Answer**: You can, but it makes saving work difficult. Instead, create a "scratchpad":

1. Create a new `.R` script: In RStudio Menu Bar -> File -> New File -> R Script. 
1. Save this as `scratchpad.R`
1. Copy/paste/tweak any code in your scratchpad, not in console window. For example, for this exercise write: `1+1`
1. To "run" code in the console (in other words tell R to "do this"), you can do one of the following:
    1. Copy it from scratchpad, then paste it in console, then hit enter.
    1. Highlight the code you want to run, then click on "Run"
    1. Highlight the code you want to run, then press control+enter on Windows/Unix/Chromebook or âŒ˜+enter on macOS.

### 3. In-class exercise 2

As marked in the Schedule at the top of this page, read ModernDive 3-3.3.1 (start of Chapter 3 to the end of 3.3.1).

* Do not ignore the "Needed Packages" section at the beginning. Recall:
    + The phone vs app analogy described in ModernDive 2.3.
    + If you are using RStudio Server in your browser, these packages come pre-installed.
    + If you are using RStudio Desktop installed on your computer, you'll have to ensure these packages are installed.
* Please skip the "Introduction to the Tidyverse" DataCamp course mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 3 for now.
* "Learning checks": These are practice problems that you do not need to submit. Should you write your answers down? If you feel like you would benefit, then yes! I will post solutions to the learning checks before the next lecture!

# Lec 3

* Go over previous Slack `#general_announcements`
* If you haven't already, **please** complete the [Intro Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTI6UM9OlYygbZQU_gQPtQPGplFIXzmE_YCMPT_1bSkDd3Zw/viewform){target="_blank"} from Lec 1.
* Syllabus discussion:
    + Added full topic schedule
    + Added office hours
    + Added *expectations* to following sections: Basic Course Information, Topic Schedule and Readings, Evaluation, Accommodations, Code of Conduct

## Today's Topics/Activities       
        
1. Go over ModernDive Chapter 2. Note:
    + You can skip all videos and linked DataCamp courses.
    + "Learning checks": These are practice problems that you do not need to submit. Should you write your answers down? If you feel like you would benefit, then yes! I will post solutions to the learning checks before the next lecture!
1. Start Problem set 1 below. I will discuss the DataCamp interface at 11:55am.

## Getting help

A big part of learning data science tools is learning how to get help effectively. For example, in this course:

**In class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask the people sitting next to you. 
1. Raise your hand to ask the data assistant or myself.

**Outside of class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask yourself "Are there people I work with in class that I can Slack?"
1. If you all don't know, post a question on Slack in the `#r_questions` channel.
1. Visit the Spinelli Center for tutoring Sunday-Thursday 7-9pm (see [syllabus](syllabus.html#basicinfo) for more info).

    * If you have already completed the "Intro to R" DataCamp course previously using a DataCamp account based on your Smith email, you do not need to re-do them; they will show up in my logs as completed.
1. **Administrative stuff**: To receive full credit for this portion simply ensure
    * On Slack:
        1. Your full name is listed: full name = how you would like to be addressed in class & last name.  
        1. You have added a profile picture with your face visible. This will help me learn your names.
        1. Hint: Start relying on Google! "How do I change my name and profile picture on Slack?"
        1. You are a member of the `#moderndive_typoes`, `#r_questions`, and `random` channels.
    * On DataCamp: Your full name is listed in your [profile](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/account_settings){target="_blank"}; the rest is optional.
