Everything in this course builds up to the final group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.* To get practice however there will be 3 mini-projects first.

# 2. Mini-project 2: Data wrangling {#miniproj2}

> **NOTE: All of the below is subject to change! I will do my best to ensure that all instructions are consistent and clear and to notify you of any changes with ample notice. Thank you for your patience and understanding!**

* **Due**: Friday 11/2 5pm
* **Learning Goals**: To further sharpen data wrangling and data visualization skills
* **Technical Skills**: `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages
* **Readings**:  Chapters 4 and 5 of ModernDive as chief readings, Chapters 2 thru 5 of "Modern Data Science with R" as supplementary readings if you want more details.


## Details

You will work with a partner to analyze Federal Election Commission data and report your findings in a short writeup. The topic is up to you. The best projects will:

* discuss an interesting and well-motivated topic
* involve some non-trivial data wrangling (e.g. not just a bunch of `mutate()`s)
* provide a well thought-out, informative analysis
* convey some sort of insight
* be well-written

**Examples**: Some examples. These were somewhat arbitrarily chosen to give a qualitative sense of the outcome; not because they were necessarily the best. 

* [Example 1](static/projects/mini_project_2/MP2_example_1.html){target="_blank"}
* [Example 2](static/projects/mini_project_2/MP2_example_2.html){target="_blank"}
* [Example 3](static/projects/mini_project_2/MP2_example_3.html){target="_blank"}



## Data

Look at the `#general_annoucements` post on Slack from Friday 10/12 for the `data.zip` file. These data come from the [Federal Election Commission](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#archive_link), and are based on the 2011--2012 federal election cycle. These data were collected using the [`fec`](https://github.com/beanumber/fec) package for R. 

> **Be sure to read the [supporting documentation for these data](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#archive_link)!!** It is your responsibility to know what you are looking at!


## What to do

* You will create an R Markdown HTML report based on a template `.Rmd` file that you will fill in (template file to be posted in Lec16 on Monday 10/15)
* Details how to use R Markdown will be introduced in Lec16 on Monday 10/15.



## Grading Rubric

There are 14 possible points for this mini-project.

**Baseline**

 * +1 for an `.Rmd` that compiles without errors
 * +1 for using [code folding](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#code_folding) to keep your code hidden, but still make it available.
 * +1 for using at least two of the five basic verbs (i.e., `select()`, `mutate()`, etc.)
 * +1 for annotating your data wrangling pipeline (this can be in a few sentences in text surrounding the R code chunks, or some informative comments inside the R code chunks)
 * +1 unnecessary messages from R are hidden from being displayed in the HTML

**Average**

 * +1 for having **at least 400** words and **no more than 600** words (use [the word count add-in](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin))
 * +1 for explaining in a single coherent sentence what we can learn from these data
 * +1 for using at least one join (e.g. `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, etc.)
 * +1 for providing context or background useful in interpreting the graphic

**Advanced**

 * +1 for writing a function to generalize your analysis rather than re-writing the same code multiple times
* +0–4 "wow" factor: awarded at the grader’s discretion for submissions that are exceptionally compelling. What does "wow" factor mean? Ask yourself:
    + What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" calculus assignment?
    + What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" essay?
    + Guess what this mini-project is more like? A calculus assignment or an essay?

# 1. Mini-project 1: Data visualization {#miniproj1}

* **Due**: Friday 10/5 5pm
* **Structure**: Near identical to as in [Spring 2018](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/mod_viz.html){target="_blank"}, with a few differences in submission format and grading rubric
* **Learning Goal**: To make informative, appropriate, and compelling data graphics.
* **Technical Skills**: `ggplot2` package
* **Readings**:  ModernDive as chief readings, Chapters 2 & 3 of "Modern Data Science with R" as supplementary readings if you want more details.

## Details

**Edited 10/3**: ~~You will work with a partner to write a short blog post that contains (at least) one data graphic. Your goal is to tell us something interesting using a well-crafted, thoughtfully-prepared data graphic. One data graphic should suffice, but you may include more if you choose.~~ You will work with a partner to write a short blog post that contains one data graphic. Your goal is to tell us something interesting using a well-crafted, thoughtfully-prepared data graphic.

Your blog post should be short. We envision an introductory paragraph that explains your findings and provides some context to your data, the data graphic, and then a caption-like paragraph providing more detail about what to look for in the data graphic and how to interpret it. That is it. You will not earn more points by including more words or data graphics. What we are looking for is something that is insightful and well-crafted. As always, you should spend some time thinking about context, scale, color, etc.

Here are some examples of articles that are similar in spirit to yours. Most of these are much longer than yours will be, and may contain multiple graphics, but the idea is similar: use a good data graphic to tell us something we don’t already know.

* [How to Tell Someone’s Age When All You Know Is Her Name](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/){target="_blank"}
* [A Better Way To Find The Best Flights And Avoid The Worst Airports](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fastest-airlines-fastest-airports/){target="_blank"}
* [NYC Taxis and Uber](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/){target="_blank"}
* [Data on people who went to ER for wall-punching](https://flowingdata.com/2016/01/14/data-on-people-who-wall-punching/){target="_blank"}


## Data

You are free to use whatever data you want. However, the purpose of this exercise is to learn how to make good data graphics – not to wrangle data (don’t worry – we’re headed there next). So we don’t want you to spend much time wrangling data. There are perfectly good data sets available through R packages that are already well-curated:

* `nycflights13`: data about flights leaving from the three major NYC airports in 2013
* `babynames`: history of baby names from the Social Security Administration
* `Lahman`: comprehensive historical archive of major league baseball data
* `fueleconomy`: fuel economy data from the EPA, 1985–2015
* `fivethirtyeight`: provides access to data sets that drive many articles on FiveThirtyEight. See a list of all datasets [here](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/articles/fivethirtyeight.html#data-sets){target="_blank"}.

To view all the datasets included in a package, the `babynames` dataset for example, run the following in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Remember, you need to always load/open the package first!
library(babynames)
data(package = "babynames")
```


## What to do

1. As a group:
    + Identify your group number from the Groups table below.
    + Download the <a href="static/projects/mini_project_1_template.R" download>`mini_project_1_template.R`</a> template `.R` scratchpad for this project and upload it to RStudio Server as you would a problem set.
    + Following the format of `mini_project_1_template.R` and the copy/paste/tweak approach to coding, change all elements of the template to create your graphic. Note I've included an example of a scatterplot for illustrative purposes. Your graphic can be anything!
    + "Export" the image to `.png` format. In the RStudio panel where your plot is, click "Export" -> "Save as Image..."
    + Include this image in a Google Doc. You will write your blogpost in this Google Doc. **Added on 10/4**: Share this Google Doc with your partner and with me: `akim04@smith.edu`
1. Designate a team leader who will do the following:
    + Submit the `mini_project_1_template.R` file for your Group on [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=29919){target="_blank"}.
    + **Added on 9/28**: If you are using data that included in a separate file (like an Excel or `.csv` file), submit this too. If you do not, I will not be able to *reproduce and replicate* your results.
    + Complete the following [Group Leader Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIITfjUr7rfCefYo8Ojy16lqM8cSx1u7Ky4RLjDZqKkFNFtw/viewform){target="_blank"}
1. Individually: Complete the following (confidential) [Individual Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcch_Z8G49TpNA3IbGlprCZWpJSux49WUeANXAKHtfcJzdVw/viewform){target="_blank"} describing your project experience.



## Grading Rubric

There are 17 possible points for this mini-project. 

**Baseline**

* +1 for R code that generates the plot without errors and is *reproducible and replicable*. In other words, if you send the `.R` file to your collaborator, would they be able to recreate your work? See [Problem set 2](index.html#PS02)
* +1 for describing the dataset
* +1 for having a data graphic
* +1 for including the code that generated the data graphic. **Added on 10/3**: This code should be in the `mini_project_1_template.R` file and not the Google Doc
* +1 for describing the visual mapping (i.e. a key). **Added on 10/3**: What this means is describing the mapping of variables to aesthetic attributes. 

**Average**

* +1 for including a catchy and/or engaging title
* +1 for having at least 100 words and no more than 300 words of text. **Added on 10/3**: To keep things simple, let's have no footnotes. Also words in the graphic itself do not count in the word count.
* +1 for explaining in a single coherent sentence what we can learn from this graphic
* +1 for explaining the choice of geometric mapping
* **Edited on 9/28**: ~~+1 for explaining the color mapping~~ +1 for justifying/explaining the choice of color mapping, even if none. In other words, do not add color for sake of adding color (this is called [chartjunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk){target="_blank"}). Rather use color only if you feel it adds value to your plot. **Added on 10/10**: It's subjective! 
* **Edited on 10/3**: ~~+1 for explaining which variables are mapped to which visual cues, and why.~~  +1 for explaining any additional variables that are mapped to any visual cues, such as facets, if you choose to use them.

**Advanced**

* +2 blog post text provides context or background useful in interpreting the graphic
* +0–4 "wow" factor: awarded at the grader’s discretion for submissions that are exceptionally compelling. 
* **Added on 10/3**: What does "wow" factor mean? Ask yourself:
    + What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" calculus assignment?
    + What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" essay?
    + Guess what this mini-project blogpost is more like? A calculus assignment or an essay?
* **Added on 10/3**: After the project feedback is returned, I will present a few examples of mini-projects that I found satisfied the "wow" criteria. 
* **Added on 10/3**: Recall this mini-project is weighted much less than the others (5%). The mini-projects are a series of practice rounds building up to the final project.
