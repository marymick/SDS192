Everything in this course builds up to the final group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.*

To get practice however there will be 3 mini-projects first.


***

# 1. Mini-project 1: Data visualization (Due 10/5)

* The format of the project will be exactly the same as [Spring 2018](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/mod_viz.html){target="_blank"}. In particular the following sections: 
    + Learning Goal
    + Technical Skills
    + Readings: ModernDive as chief readings, Chapters 2 & 3 of "Modern Data Science with R" as supplementary readings if you want more details.
    + Mini-Project
    + Data
* As for the rubric and exact submission format, those will be presented on Monday.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
roster <- read_csv("static/roster.csv")
set.seed(76)
names <- paste(roster$given_name, roster$last_name, sep = " ") %>% 
  sample() %>% 
  matrix(ncol = 2)
colnames(names) <- c("Member 1", "Member 2")
names %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(team = 1:n()) %>% 
  select(team, everything()) %>% 
    rename(
    Team = team,
    `Member 1` = Member.1,
    `Member 2` = Member.2
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
