library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Recall the Slack poll in the #polls channel on imposter syndrome. Let's load
# two representations of the results saved in two CSV's. We do this using the
# read_csv() function in the readr package.
poll_results_A <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS192/static/PS/poll_results_A.csv")

# Question 1 -------------------
# a) Using the poll_results_A data frame, recreate Fig 1. For all
# plots don't worry about getting the axes labels and titles to match. Just
# focus on the bars.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# b) Using the poll_results_A data frame, recreate Fig 2.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# c) Using the poll_results_B data frame, recreate Fig 2.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# d) Using the poll_results_A data frame, recreate Fig 3. Note Fig 3 uses the
# the default palette.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# e) Using the poll_results_A data frame, recreate Fig 4.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# f) Using the poll_results_B data frame, recreate Fig 4.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# g) Using the poll_results_B data frame, recreate Fig 5.
# Write your ggplot() code below:



# h) You find out from Smith administrators that they have been making an effort
# the last four years to raise awareness about imposter syndrome to normalize it
# amongst the student body. They want to know how effective they've been over time.
# IN YOUR OPINION, which of the 5 figures does this job best?

# 


# i) Using a calculator (or R!) calculate the proportion of students from each
# year that have heard of imposter syndrome. An example of a proportion is 0.250
# indicating 25%

# First-years - The proportion is: 
# Sophomores - The proportion is:
# Juniors - The proportion is:
# Seniors - The proportion is:
