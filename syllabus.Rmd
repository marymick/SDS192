# Course Description & Objectives

* **Official course description**: On [Smith College
Course Search](https://www.smith.edu/academics/academic-program/curriculum/course-search?term=Fall+2018&dept=Statistical+and+Data+Sciences&instr=Albert+Y.+Kim&credits=&course_numb=192&course_keywd=&op=Submit&form_build_id=form-7cQWYLnNXxPrKj_HYG_M0FCUgwmOR_VZguPCdiDJOZU&form_id=campus_course_search_basic_search_form){target="_blank"}.
* **Objectives**: This semester you will
    1. Take your first steps into the world of data (see topic schedule on main page).
    1. For those new to programming, learn just enough coding and computational thinking to work with data. For those with some experience programming, start expanding your "data science toolbox."
    1. Dip your toes into the world of open-source software and start engaging with the open-source community.
    1. Tell your first "data stories" via projects.

# Materials

We will draw from the following sources:

1. ["ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R"](https://moderndive.netlify.com/){target="_blank"} by Ismay and Kim (click link in menubar above).
1. ["Modern Data Science with R"](https://mdsr-book.github.io/){target="_blank"} by Baumer, Kaplan, and Horton.
1. DataCamp: an online interactive environment for learning data science. On top of the DataCamp courses we'll cover this semester, you have free access to [ALL their courses](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/all){target="_blank"} for 6 months. 
1. ["Text Mining with R"](https://www.tidytextmining.com/){target="_blank"} by Silge and Robinson.

# Expectations

As a student in this class:

1. **Communication**: You are expected to stay on top of announcements and
direct messages in Slack.
1. **Attendance**: You are not required to inform the instructor of *occasional* absenses.
However, you are resposible for asking your peers, and not the instructor, for
what you missed.
1. **Collaboration**: While I encourage you to work with your peers for problem
sets and labs, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of
another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged
in your submissions.
1. **Honor Code**: All your work must follow the [Smith College Academic Honor
Code
Statement](https://www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/socialconduct/honorcode.php){target="_blank"};
in particular all external sources must be cited in your submissions.

# Evaluation

## Problem Sets 30%

Problem sets will involve computational assignments with written explanations. All homework must be submitted electronically before midnight of the due date. While no late submissions will be accepted, the lowest two problem set scores will be dropped in the final problem set grade.

## Quizzes and Labs 20% {#termproject}

This course will include quizzes and lab sessions. Advance notice will be given for all quizzes. The labs will be conducted primarily in R and/or DataCamp, with some supplemental exercises in other platforms at the instructorâ€™s discretion. Students are strongly encouraged to work in groups during these labs. 

## Projects 40%

You will work on 4-5 group projects (exact number TBD) over the course of the semester. These projects will be structured, but fairly open-ended to allow you be creative. Evaluation will emphasize originality and ingenuity in addition to sophistication and complexity.

## Engagement 10% {#engagement}

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in*. Some examples of behavior counter to
this principle:

* Not participating in class.
* Engaging so little with me, either in class or during office hours, that I
don't know what your voice sounds like.
* Shirking group work.
* [Ghosting](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghosting&utm_source=search-action){target="_blank"}.
* Doing the bare minimum to get by.
